# Daily UI Challenge

This is a collection of daily challenges where each day I try to design something and then create a mockup implementing that design to improve my design skills while keeping my frontend knowledge fresh :)

The format is simple, each day I'll either design something or implement the design I've created the day before. So that means, one day will be a "design day" and the next one a "code day".

The idea is to keep this going for at least 100 days and then compare my skills before and after.

# Running

First you need to install the dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

and then you can just run

```
$ yarn dev
```

This would serve the collection's index on `http://localhost:1234/`, from there you can navigate to each challenge.
